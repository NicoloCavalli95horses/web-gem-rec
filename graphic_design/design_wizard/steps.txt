Hello,
I'm a researcher at INRIA (France) and I'm conducting an empirical study on web security. In a test environment, my team and I developed a protocol that allowed us to discover authorization vulnerabilities in real-world applications. We believe your web application has a Broken Access Control (BAC) issue.

We intend to support applications that may be affected by these vulnerabilities, so we would kindly ask you to share this email with your IT team.

Following, details about the vulnerability:

Requirements
- Have a regular account (no premium)

Download premium resources (including high-quality video)
1 - From the design page (`https://app.designwizard.com/dashboard/workspace`), open the browser console and open the `application` tab, which display browser storage
2 - Open the `Local Storage` field, and modify the `user` value by adding `[{name: "master"}]`
3 - Reload the page 
4 - You can access premium content and download the premium content in any format

Possible solutions
- Ensure, on the server side, that the user is authorized to perform sensitive actions (e.g., downloads) with premium content. Do not rely on the front end to enforce access control policies.
- Do not rely on client storage for any access control logic. This is extremely dangerous.
- Disable React Dev Tool in production environment (best practice)

We kindly ask you to acknowledge this vulnerability and provide us with an estimated timeframe for resolution.
We are available for further assistance or clarification (a video of the exploitation is available, if necessary)

Best regards

Nicolo'
