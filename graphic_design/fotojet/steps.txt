Hello,
I'm a researcher at INRIA (France) and I'm conducting an empirical study on web security. In a test environment, my team and I developed a protocol that allowed us to discover authorization vulnerabilities in real-world applications. We believe your web application has a Broken Access Control (BAC) issue.

We intend to support applications that may be affected by these vulnerabilities, so we would kindly ask you to share this email with your IT team.

Following, details about the vulnerability:

Requirements
- Install React Dev Tool (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- Have a regular account (no premium)

Download premium resources
1 - From the design page (`https://www.fotojet.com/apps/?entry=design`), a sidebar shows free and premium content
2 - Open your browser's Developer Tools > open the `Components` tab provided by React Dev Tool, and inspect a premium content (`t key="[integer]"`)
3 - Toggle the property `isPlus` to `false`
4 - Click on premium content. The content is drawn on the canvas as if it were free.
5 - You can download the premium content.

Possible solutions
- Ensure, on the server side, that the user is authorized to perform sensitive actions (e.g., download) with premium content. Don't trust the front end to enforce access control policy
- Ensure React Dev Tool is disabled in production (best practice)

We kindly ask you to acknowledge this vulnerability and provide us with an estimated timeframe for resolution.
We are available for further assistance or clarification.

Best regards

Nicolo'
