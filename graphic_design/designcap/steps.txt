Hello,
I am a researcher at INRIA (France) and I am conducting an empirical study on web security. In a test environment, my team and I have developed a protocol that has allowed us to discover authorization vulnerabilities in real applications. We believe that your web application have BAC (Broken Access Control) issues: by manipulating React components state, we were able to download premium content in the 'modules' category.

We intend to support applications that may be affected by these vulnerabilities, so we would kindly ask you to share this email with your IT team.

Following, details about the vulnerability:

Requirements
- Install React Dev Tool (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- Have a regular account (no premium)

Download premium resources
- From the main page (`https://www.designcap.com/app/`), create a new project
- From the new project's page, open the Browser Developer Tools > open the `Components` tab provided by the React Dev Tool extension.
- Using the component picker, select the component that renders the desired premium resource in the 'modules' category
- Edit the component props (e.g., `$r.props.policy = 0` or use the React Dev Tool interface).
- Click on the premium content. The premium content is now accessible.
- You can download the premium content

Possible solutions
- Ensure React Dev Tool is disabled in production (best practice)
- Verify, on the server side, that the user is authorized to perform sensitive actions (e.g., download) with premium content

We kindly ask you to acknowledge this vulnerability and provide us with an estimated timeframe for resolution.
We are available for further assistance or clarification (a supporting video is available if required)

Best regards

Nicolo'
