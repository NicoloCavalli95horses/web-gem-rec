Hello,
I am a researcher at INRIA (France) and I am conducting an empirical study on web security. This mainly involves studying how JavaScript frameworks are used to enforce access control policies and analyzing HTTP traffic from a security perspective.

In a test environment, my team and I have developed a protocol that has allowed us to discover authorization vulnerabilities in real applications. We believe that your web application have BAC (Broken Access Control) issues.

We intend to support applications that may be affected by these vulnerabilities, so we would kindly ask you to share this email with your IT team.

Following, details about the vulnerability:

Requirements
Install React Dev Tool (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
Have a regular account (no premium)

Download premium resources without watermark
- From the main page (`https://www.fotor.com/`), create a new project (e.g. `Instagram post`)
- Open the Browser Developer Tools -> open the `Components` tab provided by the React Dev Tool extension.
- Using the component picker, select the component that renders the desired premium resource 
- Edit the component props (e.g., `$r.props.data.vip = false` or use the React Dev Tool interface).
- Drag the premium content onto the canvas.
- The premium content is now accessible.
- You can download the premium content without watermark

Possible solutions
- Ensure React Dev Tool is disabled in production (best practice)
- Verify, on the server side, that the user is authorized to perform sensitive actions (e.g., download) with premium content

We kindly ask you to acknowledge this vulnerability and provide us with an estimated timeframe for resolution.
We are available for further assistance or clarification.

Best regards

Nicolo'
