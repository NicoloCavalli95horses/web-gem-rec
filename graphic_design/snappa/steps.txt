Hello,
I am a researcher at INRIA (France) and I am conducting an empirical study on web security. In a test environment, my team and I have developed a protocol that has allowed us to discover authorization vulnerabilities in real applications.
We believe https://snappa.com/ has a BAC (Broken Access Control) vulnerability: by feeding the front end with controlled HTTP responses, we were able to download premium content bypassing the user credit system.
We intend to support you in the process of recognizing and solving the issue.

Following, details about the vulnerability:

Setup
- Install Tweak (Chrome). Note that tampering with HTTP responses can be done at a lower level by leveraging instrumented browsers engines (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)

Prerequisites
- Having a regular account (no premium)

Step to reproduce

Bypass user credit system (see video attached)
- From the editor page (`https://snappa.com/app/graphic/[id]`), select a template and perform 3 downloads. A popup appears preventing the user to download more content
- Open the browser's Developer Tools > open the `network` tab, turn on the network recording and reload the page
- Once a download fails, copy the request URL to Tweak (`https://snappa.com/api/graphic/getRemaining`) and also copy the response body.
- Replace the response body with: `{"success":true,"sharemax":false}`
- Reload the page
- Download feature is now enabled (temporary elevation of privileges).

Possible solutions
- Ensure that critical features (such as download content) are fully handled server-side, independently of any frontend state

We are available to provide further details or assistance. We kindly ask for an official acknowledgement of these vulnerabilities and an estimate of the fix time.

Attached, you will find a video highlighting the vulnerability. 
We declare that we have not disclosed these vulnerabilities to any third party. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. We hope to hear from you soon.

Nicolò
