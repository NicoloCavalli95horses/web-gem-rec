Hello,
I am a researcher at INRIA (France) and I am conducting an empirical study on web security. This mainly involves studying how JavaScript frameworks are used to enforce access control policies and analyzing HTTP traffic from a security perspective.

In a test environment, my team and I have developed a protocol that has allowed us to discover authorization vulnerabilities in real applications. We believe that your web application have BAC (Broken Access Control) issues.

We intend to support applications that may be affected by these vulnerabilities, so we would kindly ask you to share this email with your IT team.

Following, details about the vulnerability:

Requirements
- Install React Dev Tool (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- Have a regular account (no premium)

Download premium resources without watermark
- From the main page, create a new project (example URL `https://picsart.com/create/editor?category=templates&customSize=1080x1080&unit=px`)
- Open the left sidebar, clicking on `background`
- Open the Browser Developer Tools -> open the `Components` tab provided by the React Dev Tool extension.
- Using the component picker, select the component that renders the target premium resource 
- Edit the component props from the browser console (e.g., `$r.props.texture.paid = false; $r.props.texture.is_paid = false; $r.props.texture.resource.is_paid = false; $r.props.texture.resource.paid = false`).
- Click on the premium content
- The premium content is now accessible without watermark
- You can download the premium content without watermark

We believe this attack could lead to massive access to a large portion of premium resources. Attached is an example video.

Possible solutions
- Ensure React Dev Tool is disabled in production (best practice)
- Verify, on the server side, that the user is authorized to perform sensitive actions (e.g., download) with premium content. Don't trust front-end state when enforcing access control policies

We kindly ask you to acknowledge this vulnerability and provide us with an estimated timeframe for resolution.
We are available for further assistance or clarification.

Best regards

Nicolo'
