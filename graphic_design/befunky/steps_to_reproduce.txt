Hello,
I am a researcher at INRIA (France) and I am conducting an empirical study on web security. In a test environment, my team and I have developed a protocol that has allowed us to discover authorization vulnerabilities in real applications. We believe that your web application have BAC (Broken Access Control) issues.

We intend to support applications that may be affected by these vulnerabilities, so we would kindly ask you to share this email with your IT team.

Following, details about the vulnerability:

Requirements
- Install Tweak (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tweak-mock-and-modify-htt/feahianecghpnipmhphmfgmpdodhcapi). Please note that HTTP tampering can be done with multiple techniques (see https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3355369.3355599)
- Have a regular account (no premium)

Download premium resources
1 - From the main page (`https://www.befunky.com/dashboard/`), create a new project (e.g., `graphic designer`).
2 - Open your browser's Developer Tools -> open the `network` tab, enable network logging, clear the logs, and reload the page.
3 - Open Templates (`search templates` button).
4 - Select the HTTP request responsible for retrieving information about the available template (`editors-choice-template/`).
5 - Copy the request and its response into Tweak. Edit the response body by replacing `"f":0` with `"f":1`. Tweak will intercept this HTTP message and inject the modified response body, transforming all premium content into free content.
6 - Reload the page and access the premium content. The premium content is now accessible.
7 - You can download the premium content.

Attached is a supporting video demonstrating the vulnerability.

Possible solutions
- Ensure, on the server side, that the user is authorized to perform sensitive actions (e.g., download) with premium content. Don't trust the front end to enforce access control policy
- Ensure React Dev Tool is disabled in production (best practice)

We kindly ask you to acknowledge this vulnerability and provide us with an estimated timeframe for resolution.
We are available for further assistance or clarification.

Best regards

Nicolo'
