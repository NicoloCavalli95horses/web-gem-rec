Hello,
I am a researcher at INRIA (France) and I am conducting an empirical study on web security. In a test environment, my team and I have developed a protocol that has allowed us to discover authorization vulnerabilities in real applications.
We believe https://desygner.com/  has a BAC (Broken Access Control) vulnerability: by feeding the front end with controlled HTTP responses, we were able to access and download any premium content.
We intend to support you in the process of recognizing and solving the issue.

Following, details about the vulnerability:

Setup
Install Tweak (Chrome). Note that tampering with HTTP responses can be done at a lower level by leveraging instrumented browsers engines (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP). For more details about JavaScript instrumentation see Jueckstock et al 2019.

Prerequisites
Having a regular account (no premium)

Step to reproduce

Access to premium content (see video `download_premium.mp4`)
From the dashboard (`https://desygner.com/editor/[id]`), open the sidebar and select premium content. A popup prevents the user from accessing the content.
Open the browser's Developer Tools > open the `network` tab, add the `templates_consume` filter, and reload the page.
Once the sidebar opens, two HTTP messages are now available. Select the first: copy the request URL to Tweak and also copy the response body.
Replace each occurrence of `"is_premium": true` with `"is_premium": false` in the response body.
Reload the page.
Premium content is now available and downloadable (temporary elevation of privileges).

Possible solutions
Ensure that critical features (such as download content) are fully handled server-side, independently of any frontend state
Disable React Dev Tool access in production (best practice)

We are available to provide further details or assistance. We kindly ask for an official acknowledgement of these vulnerabilities and an estimate of the fix time.

Attached, you will find three demonstration videos highlighting the vulnerabilities. 
We declare that we have not disclosed these vulnerabilities to any third party. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. We hope to hear from you soon.

Nicolò
