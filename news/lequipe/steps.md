Good afternoon,
I am a researcher at INRIA (France) and I am conducting an empirical study on web security. We believe that your website is affected by BAC (Broken Access Control) issues: we found that premium article (reserved to paying users) are still available for regular users. It is possible to access the whole content of a premium article by accessing the body of the first HTTP message received. The content is available at the `articleBody` key.

We are available to provide further details or assistance. Attached, you will find a video highlighting the problem. We declare that we have not disclosed this issue to any third party.
Thank you for your time and consideration. We hope to hear from you soon.

Nicolo'
