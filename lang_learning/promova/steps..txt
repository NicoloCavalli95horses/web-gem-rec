[THIS IS NOT SPAM, PLEASE HELP US TO REACH YOUR IT TEAM] 





Hello,

I am a researcher at INRIA (France) and I am conducting an empirical study on web security. In a test environment, my team and I have developed a protocol that has allowed us to discover authorization vulnerabilities in real applications. We believe that your web application (https://promova.com/) have BAC (Broken Access Control) issues. We intend to support applications that may be affected by these vulnerabilities, so we would kindly ask you how we can contact the IT team involved.



Following, details about the vulnerability:



Access to premium lessons without payment



Setup

Having React Dev Tool installed (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
Having a regular account (no premium)

Step to reproduce
Go to page `myplan` (https://promova.com/my-plan)
Select a blocked lesson. A popup appears, preventing the access
Open the Browser Development Tools > open the tab `Components` provided by the React Dev Tool extension
Using the component selector, select the component that renders the blocked level of your choice
The component should be named `Anonymous key=[ID]`. Among its props, there is the property `lesson.free: false`
On the browser console, run `$r.props.lesson.free = true`. This will grab the selected component, access its props and modify the value of the property `free`
In order for the component to be updated, it has to be mounted and remounted again. Click on the selected locked level, close the popup and try again
The blocked level is now accessible
The level is fully executable but the results are not saved (temporary privilege elevation)
 

Attached, a video demonstrating the exploitation. We kindly ask you for an estimated resolution time and the ability to officially acknowledge the vulnerability.


We hope this collaboration will be useful to your business and that of many other companies.


Thank you for your time and consideration.



Nicolò
